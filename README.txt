Python 3.8.5

Submitted files:
- SP_main.py 		main script with the implemented model
- SP_func.py 		script with functions used in SP_main.py 
- spell.py 		P.Norvigs off-the-shelf model
- testsets.py 		test items for evaluation
- big.txt		language corpus
- missp.dat		error corpus
- Bangura_project.pdf 	project report

Instructions:
1. All submitted files should be in the same directory. 
2. Run SP_main.py to produce the output with test results for the implemented model.
3. Run spell.py to test the off-the-shelf model.

Expected runtime of SP_main.py: 45 min (appx. 5 minutes per each test); can be reduced by tuning parameters of the "test" function in SP_main.py
